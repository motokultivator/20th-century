# 20th-century
*Historical, experimental/deprecated/abandoned projects from the last century*

This repo/directory represents a collection of experimental programs from the end of the 20th century. It includes various [TSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminate-and-stay-resident_program "TSR") programs, some algorithms related to image processing, experiments with interrupt routines and peripherals, code injection, drivers, game hacking, and an attempt to replace the DOS interrupt 21h.
At the time authors' main ambitions were to gain elevated privileges on [Novell Netware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetWare "Novell Netware") system (in order to simplify their high school education) and to make a fast GFX library for game development.

Programs were written in [Borland Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal "Borland Turbo Pascal"), [Borland Turbo C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B "Borland Turbo C++"), and[ Borland Turbo Assembler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Assembler " Borland Turbo Assembler") (the word turbo was quite popular). Written using a lot of trial and error and little documentation that could be found at local [BBSes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system "BBSes") (notably [HelpPC Reference Library](https://stanislavs.org/helppc/ "HelpPC Reference Library")), these programs are generally short and tend toward an impressionistic style.

The target operating system is MS DOS 6.2+. [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/wiki/ "DOSBox") can be used today.

The authors are ***Bojan RadoviÄ‡*** and ***Aleksandar Rikalo***. You may use this content under the terms of the LICENSE file.

All programs are published untouched - as we found them on old storage mediums. Also, all of them can be compiled under DOSBox, using aphostrated tools.
